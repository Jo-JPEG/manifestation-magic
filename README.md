# Manifestation Magic

## Overview

The purpose of Manifestation Magic is to provide users with a dedicated platform to help them manifest their goals, wishes, and dreams. This application aims to address the common challenge of staying motivated and focused on personal aspirations by offering a supportive and structured environment for daily engagement. By allowing users to create, recharge, and track their manifestations, the app encourages consistency, accountability, and positive reinforcement, ultimately helping users achieve their full potential and turn their dreams into reality.


Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

## Design

- **Design Rationale:**
  - [Explain key design decisions, such as layout, colour scheme, typography, and how accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) were integrated.]
  - [Highlight any considerations made for users with disabilities, such as screen reader support.]

### Colour Scheme

### Typography



[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

 [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) Was used to create wireframes for mobile and desktop views.

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

## Features

### Main features

#### Create Manifestation 

Users complete a form to create their own manifestation. This includes a title, description, style choice and if they wish to make the manifestation public. 

#### View Manifestation 

Each manifestation has a unique URL slug allowing users to view their manifestation. They also have a choice of styles which vary the manifestation's aethetics. 

#### Charge Manifestation

Once a user has created their manifestation, they can recharge it by clicking on a button. Manifestations remain charged for 24 hours, however, users can recharge their manifestation again after 12 hours have passed. This improves the user experience, as users do not have to wait a full 24 hours until they can recharge. This means they do not have to charge at the same time every day but at a time that is convenient for them. 

The idea behind recharging manifestations is that it encourages users to remember their manifestations and goals. The charge button is a statisfying way for users to remain focused on their goals and aspirations. 

#### Share Manifestation 

User can choose to make a manifestation public, allowing it to be viewable to others once it has receaved admin approval. This allows users to share thier important goals and wishes as well as take inspiration from other users. The requirement for admin approval ensures that inappropriate or harmful content is not shared publicly. 
If a user edits their public manifestation at any time, it will automatically be resubmitted for admin approval. This ensures that any content that is publicly shared is appropriate for all. 

### General features on each page

#### Navigation

As a mobile-first design, Manifestation Magic provides a toggle icon for the navigation menu on screens less than 768 pixels wide. On mobile, the menu has a vertical layout.

On wider screens, a horizontal navigation bar is always visible at the top of the site. 

#### Footer

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

## AI Implementation and Orchestration

### Use Cases and Reflections:
(Highlight how prompts, such as reverse, question-and-answer or multi-step, were used to support learners with SEND or ALN where relevant.)

  - **Code Creation:** 
    - Reflection: Strategic use of AI allowed for rapid prototyping, with minor adjustments for alignment with project goals. 
    - Examples: Reverse prompts for alternative code solutions and question-answer prompts for resolving specific challenges.
  - **Debugging:** 
    - Reflection: Key interventions included resolving logic errors and enhancing maintainability, with a focus on simplifying complex logic to make it accessible.
  - **Performance and UX Optimization:** 
    - Reflection: Minimal manual adjustments were needed to apply AI-driven improvements, which enhanced application speed and user experience for all users.
  - **Automated Unit Testing:**
    - Reflection: Adjustments were made to improve test coverage and ensure alignment with functionality. Prompts were used to generate inclusive test cases that considered edge cases for accessibility.

- **Overall Impact:**
  - AI tools streamlined repetitive tasks, enabling focus on high-level development.
  - Efficiency gains included faster debugging, comprehensive testing, and improved code quality.
  - Challenges included contextual adjustments to AI-generated outputs, which were resolved effectively, enhancing inclusivity.
  - Copilot did remove a vital piece of code while changing the id to slugs.

###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
