# Manifestation Magic

## Overview

The purpose of Manifestation Magic is to provide users with a dedicated platform to help them manifest their goals, wishes, and dreams. This application aims to address the common challenge of staying motivated and focused on personal aspirations by offering a supportive and structured environment for daily engagement. By allowing users to create, recharge, and track their manifestations, the app encourages consistency, accountability, and positive reinforcement, ultimately helping users achieve their full potential and turn their dreams into reality.


Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

## Design

- **Design Rationale:**
  - [Explain key design decisions, such as layout, colour scheme, typography, and how accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG) were integrated.]
  - [Highlight any considerations made for users with disabilities, such as screen reader support.]

### Colour Scheme

 [coolors](https://coolors.co/)

### Typography

If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.



## Features



### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

-HTML
-CSS

-Django


### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

-Microsoft Copilot was used (See AI Implementation and Orchestration)
-Balsamic for initial wireframe creation
-FireAlpaca for creating custom images 

## AI Implementation and Orchestration

### Use Cases and Reflections:
(Highlight how prompts, such as reverse, question-and-answer or multi-step, were used to support learners with SEND or ALN where relevant.)

  - **Code Creation:** 
    - Reflection: Strategic use of AI allowed for rapid prototyping, with minor adjustments for alignment with project goals. 
    - Examples: Reverse prompts for alternative code solutions and question-answer prompts for resolving specific challenges.
  - **Debugging:** 
    - Reflection: Key interventions included resolving logic errors and enhancing maintainability, with a focus on simplifying complex logic to make it accessible.
  - **Performance and UX Optimization:** 
    - Reflection: Minimal manual adjustments were needed to apply AI-driven improvements, which enhanced application speed and user experience for all users.
  - **Automated Unit Testing:**
    - Reflection: Adjustments were made to improve test coverage and ensure alignment with functionality. Prompts were used to generate inclusive test cases that considered edge cases for accessibility.

- **Overall Impact:**
  - AI tools streamlined repetitive tasks, enabling focus on high-level development.
  - Efficiency gains included faster debugging, comprehensive testing, and improved code quality.
  - Challenges included contextual adjustments to AI-generated outputs, which were resolved effectively, enhancing inclusivity.


## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

- **Platform:** [Platform used, e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.]
- **High-Level Deployment Steps:** 
  1. [Step 1]
  2. [Step 2]
  3. [Step 3]
- **Verification and Validation:**
  - Steps taken to verify the deployed version matches the development version in functionality.
  - [Include any additional checks to ensure accessibility of the deployed application.]
- **Security Measures:**
  - Use of environment variables for sensitive data.
  - Ensured DEBUG mode is disabled in production.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

- **Manual Testing:**
  - **Devices and Browsers Tested:** [List devices and browsers, ensuring testing was conducted with assistive technologies such as screen readers or keyboard-only navigation.]
  - **Features Tested:** [Summarise features tested manually, e.g., CRUD operations, navigation.]
  - **Results:** [Summarise testing results, e.g., "All critical features worked as expected, including accessibility checks."]
- **Automated Testing:**
  - Tools Used: [Mention any testing frameworks or tools, e.g., Django TestCase.]
  - Features Covered: [Briefly list features covered by automated tests.]
  - Adjustments Made: [Describe any manual corrections to AI-generated test cases, particularly for accessibility.]

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
